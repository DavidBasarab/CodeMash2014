Beginning Software Craftsmanship
============

In this interactive session, you'll learn some of the basic principles and practices of writing better quality code: testing and pairing. You'll work with a variety of partners on coding katas designed to instill best practices that you'll then be ready to apply when next you work on production code. This session is led by the organizers of the Hudson Software Craftsmanship group and provides a great introduction to the afternoon's Intermediate Software Craftsmanship session (though this is not a prerequisite for that session). Attendees should already be comfortable with a programming language of their choice and if possible should bring along a laptop computer with their development tools installed, including a unit testing tool.
