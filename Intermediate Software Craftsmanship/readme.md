Intermediate Software Craftsmanship
============

Join your peers and fellow craftsmen in a variety of coding katas and exercises designed to improve your skills as software developers. Led by organizers of the Hudson Software Craftsmanship group, this interactive session will help you sharpen your tools and leardn from others. Experienced developers from all backgrounds are welcome, as are beginners (who might consider attending the morning's Beginning Software Craftsmanship session, though it's not required). Attendees should already be comfortable with a programming language of their choice and if possible should bring along a laptop computer with their development tools installed, including a unit testing tool. This session will focus on design, refactoring, and application of design patterns through practice to improve the design of existing and new software.
