The Low Risk Entrepreneur
============

You don't have to quit your day job to be an entrepreneur.  In this session, serial (and often parallel) entrepreneurs Michelle and Steve Smith will talk about ways developers (and others) can launch their own businesses from the comfort of their existing full time positions, often with the full support of their employers.  It's never been easier or cheaper to start a business, and whether you just have an idea you want to try out or you're hoping to augment your income and resume with some accomplishments outside of your current workplace, running and growing your own business can be very rewarding.

In this session, we'll talk about various kinds of opportunities and the commitments they require, employment agreement considerations, how to align your goals with your business, and how the low-risk option differs from the traditional startup approach.  Questions and discussion will of course be welcome as well.
